## Development Notes
### Aurora's Notes
<p>When making the local database with ampps for local development, all fields are varchar(255) (except age is of datatype integer)</p>
<p>Code added for testing purposes. "testing.html" and "testing.php" now use input fields instead of API</p>
<p>Current 'testing' set is **NOT VULNERABLE**, currently using prepared statements. </p>
